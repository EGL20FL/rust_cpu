rustc filename.rs for see results of a code

Few files for understanding core things. Why u do not organize all files in a project? Have a reason. 

Ok Ok Okey

The point is to give understunding of shellcode executing in cpu. No water. Want to swim? Jump.

P.S. JOP - later? but soon

1) **shell.rs** we see [hexcode](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal#:~:text=numeral%20system%20with%2016%20as,numbers%20and%20six%20extra%20symbols) 488d35140000006a01586a0c5a4889c70f056a3c5831ff0f05ebfe68656c6c6f20776f726c640a simple explain of it. It goes inside CPU and print Hello
2) why it works u can think at **cpu.rs** 
3) but first look how u can see it **print_opcode.rs**
4) then look **print_mem.rs** and u may see how does it looks like in memmory buffer
5) and now once again look at **cpu.rs**

**This scheme is not for everyone to understand but it my seeing of task**
